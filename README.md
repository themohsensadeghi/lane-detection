# 🚗 Lane Detection using OpenCV (Python)

A classical computer vision project for detecting road lane lines using **Canny Edge Detection**, **Region of Interest Masking**, and **Hough Line Transform**.  
This implementation is optimized for **Google Colab**, supports **video processing**, and is easy to extend into advanced lane detection pipelines.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Detects left & right lane lines from video or images  
- 🎯 Uses Canny edge detection for robust lane extraction  
- 🔻 Applies Region of Interest (ROI) masking to ignore irrelevant areas  
- 📐 Hough Line Transform for line segment detection  
- 🎥 Works on videos frame-by-frame  
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight (pure OpenCV)  
- 🔬 Google Colab-friendly (no `cv2.imshow()`)  
- 🧩 Easily expandable to polynomial lane fitting or neural networks
